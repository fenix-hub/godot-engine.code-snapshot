# Code Snapshot
A plugin for Godot Engine which will let you take beautified snapshots of your code within the Editor.  Configure the frame as you like, with GDScript sintax already highlighted.  
Inspired by: [carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/) and [vscode code snapshot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robertz.code-snapshot#:~:text=Open%20the%20command%20palette%20(Ctrl,button%20to%20save%20the%20screenshot.)).
